# Projectï¼šBunny Market

## Background Overview
This project is a small-scale online second-hand trading platform for students at the Oakland campus of Northeastern University. It aims to facilitate the transfer of personal idle items within the campus. Students can either open and manage their own stores or act as consumers to purchase second-hand items from others.

## Implementation
The website is based on a multi-merchant structure, allowing different merchants to manage their own data independently. A collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is integrated for personalized recommendations, enabling tailored suggestions for users. The recommendation process leverages asynchronous multi-threading to efficiently handle data from different users.

## Key Features by Role

## GoodsService Documentation
The <code>GoodsService</code> class provides business logic for managing goods in the system. It interacts with various mappers to perform CRUD operations and includes additional functionality such as pagination and user-specific recommendations.

This service is built using Spring Framework and leverages external libraries like <code>cn.hutool</code>, <code>PageHelper</code>, and custom utility classes.

### Core Modules and Design Concepts

#### 1. Dependency Injection and Responsibility Separation

- Dependency Injection: The <code>@Resource</code> annotation is used to inject multiple mappers, such as GoodsMapper and UserMapper, to interact with the database.

- Responsibility Separation:

1. Each mapper focuses on handling data operations for a specific entity.

2. GoodsService is responsible for invoking mappers and encapsulating business logic.

#### 2. Multithreading and Asynchronous Processing

The recommendation feature uses ExecutorService for thread pooling and CountDownLatch to coordinate thread completion. This ensures efficient parallel computation.
- Thread Pool: Executors.newCachedThreadPool() dynamically allocates thread resources to avoid performance bottlenecks.

- Latch Mechanism: CountDownLatch ensures that all user-product relationship data calculations are completed before executing the recommendation algorithm.

#### 3. Recommendation Algorithm Design

The recommendation feature combines user behavior (e.g., favorites, cart additions, orders, and comments) with a collaborative filtering algorithm (UserCF).

- Behavior Weights:

1. Favorite: Weight 1

2. Add to Cart: Weight 2

3. Order: Weight 3

4. Comment: Weight 2

These behaviors are abstracted into a RelatedAlgo relationship table, which is fed into the collaborative filtering algorithm for recommendations.

#### 4. Recommendation Feature

**Method:** public List<Goods> recommend()

Principle:

Data Preparation: Extract user-product behavior data from favorites, cart, orders, and comments tables.

Weight Calculation: Use multithreading to calculate weights for each user-product pair.

Collaborative Filtering: Use UserCF.recommend to compute recommendations.
```
for (Goods goods : allGoods) {
            Integer goodsId = goods.getId();
            for (User user : allUsers) {
                threadPool.execute(() -> {
                    Integer userId = user.getId();
                    int index = 1;

                    if (allCollects.stream().anyMatch(x -> x.getGoodsId().equals(goodsId) && x.getUserId().equals(userId))) {
                        index += 1;
                    }
                    if (allCarts.stream().anyMatch(x -> x.getGoodsId().equals(goodsId) && x.getUserId().equals(userId))) {
                        index += 2;
                    }
                    if (allOrders.stream().anyMatch(x -> x.getGoodsId().equals(goodsId) && x.getUserId().equals(userId))) {
                        index += 3;
                    }
                    if (allComments.stream().anyMatch(x -> x.getGoodsId().equals(goodsId) && x.getUserId().equals(userId))) {
                        index += 2;
                    }

                    if (index > 1) {
                        data.add(new RelatedAlgo(userId, goodsId, index));
                    }
                    countDownLatch.countDown();
                });
            }
        }
```


```
List<Goods> goods = goodsMapper.selectAll(null);
for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    int index = new Random().nextInt(goods.size());
    list.add(goods.get(index));
}
return list;
```
#### 5. Optimization Suggestions

1. Recommendation Algorithm Optimization

- Current weight calculation is simple; consider introducing more dimensions (e.g., browsing history, time-based weights).

- Use more efficient collaborative filtering implementations.

2. Multithreading Optimization

- Use a fixed-size thread pool (Executors.newFixedThreadPool) to limit resource consumption.

3. Caching Mechanism

- Cache popular recommendation results using tools like Redis to reduce redundant computations.

4. Code Modularization

- Extract weight calculation logic into an independent utility class to improve code reusability.
