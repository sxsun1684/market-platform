# Projectï¼šBunny Market

## Background
This project is a small-scale online second-hand trading platform for students at the Oakland campus of Northeastern University. It aims to facilitate the transfer of personal idle items within the campus. Students can either open and manage their own stores or act as consumers to purchase second-hand items from others.

## Implementation
The website is based on a multi-merchant structure, allowing different merchants to manage their own data independently. A collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is integrated for personalized recommendations, enabling tailored suggestions for users. The recommendation process leverages asynchronous multi-threading to efficiently handle data from different users.
